You can learn more about the calculation processes, assumptions made, and how you can reduce your emission by visiting here: www.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator! \n\nThe augmented reality portion of the app is created by transforming the weight of the CO2 into volumes. The idea hit me when I was browsing plane tickets one day. I notice the site shows the CO2 released by the flight. However, I have no clue what 100 kg of carbon meant. Then it hit me it will be a lot more impactful if I can actually put 100kg of CO2 in my living room and see how much space it took up. That's why I made this app. :) \n\nUnder the hood, this app is made with SwiftUI, ARKit and RealityKit";
