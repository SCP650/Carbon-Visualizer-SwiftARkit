# Privacy Policy

We do NOT collect your data.

We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We didn't even set up a server. To put the cherry on top, there is NO thrid-party tracking/analytics/advertising in the app that would collect your data. So even if Mark Zuckerberg asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn't have anything to show.
